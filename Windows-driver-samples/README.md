# Driver samples for Windows 10
These are the official Microsoft Windows Driver Kit (WDK) team driver code samples for Windows 10. They provide a foundation for Universal Windows driver support of all hardware form factors, from phones to desktop PCs. Use these samples with Visual Studio 2015 and Windows Driver Kit (WDK) 10.

## Windows 10 driver development
Use Visual Studio 2015 and Windows Driver Kit (WDK) 10 to build, test, and deploy your drivers. With Windows 10, the driver development environment is integrated into Visual Studio. To get started, download the driver development kits and tools for Windows 10.

[Download the WDK, WinDbg, and associated tools](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/windows-driver-kit "Download the WDK, WinDbg, and associated tools for Windows 10")

### Windows 10 Driver Kit (WDK)
Take a look at the compilation of the new and changed driver-related content for Windows 10. Areas of improvement include camera, print, display, Near Field Communication (NFC), WLAN, Bluetooth, and more.

### Samples
Use the samples in this repo to guide your Windows driver development. Whether you're just getting started or porting an older driver to the newest version of Windows, code samples are valuable guides on how to write drivers.

### Build your first driver
If you're writing your first driver, use these exercises to get started. Each exercise is independent of the others, so you can do them in any order.
