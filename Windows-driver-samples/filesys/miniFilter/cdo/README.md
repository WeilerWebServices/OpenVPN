# CDO File System Minifilter Driver

The CDO minifilter sample is an example if you intend to use a control device object (CDO) with your minifilters.

Although the filter manager infrastructure provides a message interface for communication between applications and minifilters, you might need explicit CDOs while the minifilters interface with legacy software. This sample shows how to create and use a CDO with minifilters.

## Universal Windows Driver Compliant

This sample builds a Universal Windows Driver. It uses only APIs and DDIs that are included in OneCoreUAP.

Design and Operation
--------------------

When the CDO minifilter is deployed, it creates a CDO object named "FileSystem\\Filters\\CdoSample" in the Microsoft Windows object namespace and enables applications to open it and perform certain operations on it.
