# PassThrough File System Minifilter Driver

The PassThrough minifilter demonstrates how to specify callback functions for different types of I/O requests.

## Universal Windows Driver Compliant

This sample builds a Universal Windows Driver. It uses only APIs and DDIs that are included in OneCoreUAP.

## Design and Operation

The *PassThrough* minifilter does not have any real functionality. For each type of I/O operation, the same pre and post callback functions are called. These callback functions simply forward the I/O request to the next filter on the stack.
