# UMDF Driver Skeleton Sample (UMDF Version 1)

This sample demonstrates how to use version 1 of the User-Mode Driver Framework to write a minimal driver.

The Skeleton driver will successfully load on a device (either root enumerated or a real hardware device) but does not support any I/O operations.
