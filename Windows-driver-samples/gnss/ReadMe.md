# GNSS UMDF Sample Driver (UMDF Version 2)

Provides a base sample driver that IHVs and partners can use to extend to build their custom Windows GPS/GNSS drivers.

## Overview

### What is covered

* This is a sample that adheres to GNSS driver design for Windows 10 outlined in the [GNSS driver design guide for Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/gnss/gnss-driver-design-guide-for-windows-10).
* Serves as base sample driver that IHVs and partners can use as a template and guidance to extend to build their custom Windows GNSS drivers.
* Follows the WDF guidelines and best practices around PnP device arrival/removal, power management and driver installation/uninstallation.
* Supports the GNSS DDI mandatory requirements.
* This driver successfully passes HLK tests and WDF tests provided by Visual studio.

### What is not covered

* This sample currently doesn't support Geofence, SUPL, and AGNSS, as this is not mandatory GNSS DDI functionality.
* SUPL and AGNSS are mandatory only if required by mobile operator, and the sample does not support them currently.
* Not a production driver.

### What a Partner needs to do

* Customer can install WDK and run Location HLK tests to validate their driver. All test cases should be either pass or skip without failure.
* Partner owns the following:
  * Installing the driver.
  * Adding certificate and driver signing.
  * Updating manufacturer name driver version etc. (the code has comments to update).
* The GNSS sample code has "FIX ME" comments. Partner should update them accordingly.

## Design

* The sample demonstrates a very basic software only driver that meets the minimum requirements from the GNSS DDI.
* The sample currently always returns a fake hardcoded location. Driver developers can extend this to fetch fake positions from a file or inject through a custom IOCTL or instead implement getting real positions from GNSS hardware.
* Driver developer can extend this to pull the fake positions from a file or through custom IOCTLs if needed.

## Trace Logging

* The sample code provides Trace logging WPRP file.
* To capture trace log, copy GnssUmdfSampleDriver.wprp in the solution folder into the device under test. On command line (MyLog.etl is an example file name below):

    ```cmd
    wpr -start GnssUmdfSampleDriver.wprp -filemode
        <Reproduce the issue>
    wpr -stop MyLog.etl
    ```

* Inspect MyLog.etl with trace file analyzer. Note that corresponding PDB file is needed to decode the logging information.

## Test Plan

Customer should validate their driver after customizing it.

### Test method 1

* This tests WDF fundamental functionality (PnP etc.), rather than Location-specific features.
* Run Visual studio built-in run-time test for WDF.
* General information available at [](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/develop/testing-a-driver-at-runtime).
* Expected result / Pass criteria: Pass rate 100%

### Test method 2

* This tests Location-specific functionality (Getting fix etc.).
* Run [HLK](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/test/hlk/windows-hardware-lab-kit) tests with existing and standard GNSS driver tests.
* Run "TE.exe GNSSDriverTest.dll".
* Expected result / Pass criteria: Pass rate 100%
* Note that this sample does not support AGNSS, SUPL and Geofencing currently. Based on the capability of driver, HLK skips them automatically.

### Test method 3

* Test the [Windows Geolocation API](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/locationapi/windows-location-api-portal) layer on real apps.
* Get current location by clicking on "Show my location" from the In-box Windows Maps app.
* Run the tracking scenario from the [Geolocation Sample app](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/Geolocation).
* Get current location by clicking on "Start" from GPS Satellite app in Windows Store.
