# Power Framework (PoFx) Sample (UMDF Version 2)

This solution demonstrates how a User-Mode Driver Framework (UMDF) version 2 driver can implement F-state-based power management. The SingleComp project demonstrates how a UMDF version 2 driver can implement F-state-based power management for a device that has only a single component.

## Universal Windows Driver Compliant

This sample builds a Universal Windows Driver. It uses only APIs and DDIs that are included in OneCoreUAP.

Run the sample
--------------

The computer where you install the driver is called the *target computer* or the *test computer*. Typically this is a separate computer from where you develop and build the driver package. The computer where you develop and build the driver is called the *host computer*.

The process of moving the driver package to the target computer and installing the driver is called *deploying the driver*. You can deploy a driver sample automatically or manually.

### Automatic deployment (root enumerated)

Before you automatically deploy a driver, you must provision the target computer. For instructions, see [Configuring a Computer for Driver Deployment, Testing, and Debugging](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/).

1.  On the host computer, in Visual Studio, in Solution Explorer, right click **package** (lower case), and choose **Properties**. Navigate to **Configuration Properties \> Driver Install \> Deployment**.
2.  Check **Enable deployment**, and check **Remove previous driver versions before deployment**. For **Target Computer Name**, select the name of a target computer that you provisioned previously. Select **Hardware ID Driver Update**, and enter **root\\SingleComponentSingleState** for the hardware ID. Click **OK**.
3.  On the **Build** menu, choose **Build Solution**.

### Manual deployment (root enumerated)

Before you manually deploy a driver, you must turn on test signing and install a certificate on the target computer. You also need to copy the [DevCon](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff544707) tool to the target computer. For instructions, see [Preparing a Computer for Manual Driver Deployment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/develop/preparing-a-computer-for-manual-driver-deployment).

1.  Copy all of the files in your driver package to a folder on the target computer (for example, c:\\PoFx).
2.  On the target computer, open a Command Prompt window as Administrator. Navigate to your driver package folder, and enter the following command:

    **devcon install SingleComponentSingleStateUm.inf root\\SingleComponentSingleState**

### View the root enumerated driver in Device Manager

On the target computer, in a Command Prompt window, enter **devmgmt** to open Device Manager. In Device Manager, on the **View** menu, choose **Devices by type**. In the device tree, locate **UMDF 2.0 Single Component Single State Device** (for example, this might be under the **Sample Device** node).

In Device Manager, on the **View** menu, choose **Devices by connection**. Locate **UMDF 2.0 Single Component Single State Device** as a child of the root node of the device tree.

Build the sample using MSBuild
------------------------------

As an alternative to building the driver sample in Visual Studio, you can build it in a Visual Studio Command Prompt window. In Visual Studio, on the **Tools** menu, choose **Visual Studio Command Prompt**. In the Visual Studio Command Prompt window, navigate to the folder that has the solution file, PoFx.sln. Use the MSBuild command to build the solution. Here is an example:

**msbuild /p:configuration="Release" /p:platform="Win32" PoFx.sln**

For more information about using MSBuild to build a driver package, see [Building a Driver](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff554644).
