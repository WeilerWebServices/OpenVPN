# Magnetic Stripe Reader Driver Sample

This sample serves as a template for creating a new Magnetic Stripe Reader driver.  

This sample uses UMDF 2.0 and enables basic functionality such as claiming and enabling the device for exclusive access.  

It serves as an example of how to include the libraries necessary to develop a PointOfService driver.  Once a driver is developed using this template it can be compiled for, deployed, and used on x86, amd64, and ARM platforms.
