# Early Launch Anti-Malware Driver

This sample demonstrates how to use the [**IoRegisterBootDriverCallback**](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/hh439379) and [**IoUnRegisterBootDriverCallback**](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/hh439394) DDIs from an Early Launch Anti-Malware driver, to receive notifications about the initialization of regular boot start drivers.

This sample driver is a minimal driver meant to demonstrate the usage of the APIs mentioned above. It is not intended for use in a production environment.

## Signing the sample

Early Launch drivers are required to be signed with a code-signing certificate that also contains the Early Launch EKU "1.3.6.1.4.1.311.61.4.1". In a production environment, Early Launch drivers are signed by Microsoft for qualifying Anti-Malware vendors with a WHQL certificate that contains this EKU. The makecert.exe tool can be used to generate a self-signed test certificate that contains both the Early Launch EKU and the "1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.3" Code Signing EKU. Once a certificate of this form has been created, signtool.exe can be used to sign elamsample.sys.

## Run the sample

### Installing the sample

1. Copy the signed elamsample.sys file to the %WINDIR%\\System32\\Drivers directory on your test machine.

2. Use the sc.exe tool present in Windows to install the driver:

      `sc create ElamSample binpath=%windir%\\system32\\drivers\\elamsample.sys type=kernel start=boot error=critical group=Early-Launch`
 
3. Enable test signing:

      `bcdedit /set testsigning on`

## Code tour

**DriverEntry:** Creates a framework driver object and calls IoRegisterBootDriverCallback to register to boot driver status callbacks.

**ElamSampleEvtDriverUnload:** Calls IoUnregisterBootDriverCallback to unregister for callbacks when elamsample.sys is about to be unloaded.

**ElamSampleBootDriverCallback**: Dispatches to other functions to process the specific callback types.

**ElamSampleProcessStatusUpdate:** Displays callback BdCbStatusUpdate information, such as when dependencies and drivers are about to be initialized, or when the ELAM driver is about to be unload.

**ElamSampleProcessInitializeImage:** Displays callback BdCbInitializeImage information, such as the driver image name and the name of the entity that signed the driver.

**ElamSamplePrintHex:** A utility function to display a buffer in hexadecimal form.

## Testing

After installing the driver, attach the Kernel Debugger and reboot your test machine. If ELAMSAMPLE\_TRACE\_LEVEL is set to DPFLTR\_ERROR\_LEVEL, traces will be output to the debugger automatically. For example:

```cmd
ElamSample is being initialized.
