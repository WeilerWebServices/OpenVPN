# SimThermalClient - Simulated Thermal Client Sample Driver

This sample is a driver for a simulated device that is a client of Windows thermal management. This driver publishes a [GUID\_THERMAL\_COOLING\_INTERFACE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/hh698265) driver interface. Drivers publish this interface so that they can participate in global thermal management under the coordination of the Windows operating system.

## Universal Windows Driver Compliant

This sample builds a Universal Windows Driver. It uses only APIs and DDIs that are included in OneCoreUAP.
