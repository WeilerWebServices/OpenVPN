# Sample UMDF Filter above KMDF Function Driver for OSR USB-FX2 (UMDF Version 1)

The umdf\_filter\_kmdf sample demonstrates how to load a UMDF filter driver as an upper filter driver above the kmdf\_fx2 sample driver.

The sample includes Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) tracing support, and is written for the OSR USB-FX2 Learning Kit. The specification for the device is at <http://www.osronline.com/hardware/OSRFX2_32.pdf>.

## Build the sample

The default Solution build configuration is **Debug** and **Win32**.

1. Open the driver project or solution in Visual Studio (find *filtername*.sln or *filtername*.vcxproj).
1. Right-click the solution in the **Solutions Explorer** and select **Configuration Manager**.
1. From the **Configuration Manager**, select the **Active Solution Configuration** (for example, Debug or Release) and the **Active Solution Platform** (for example, Win32) that correspond to the type of build you are interested in.
1. From the **Build** menu, click **Build Solution** (Ctrl+Shift+B).

## Overview

- The device is based on the development board supplied with the Cypress EZ-USB FX2 Development Kit (CY3681).
- It contains 1 interface and 3 endpoints (Interrupt IN, Bulk Out, Bulk IN).
- Firmware supports vendor commands to query or set LED Bar graph display and 7-segment LED display, and to query toggle switch states.
- Interrupt Endpoint:
- Sends an 8-bit value that represents the state of the switches.
  - Sent on startup, resume from suspend, and whenever the switch pack setting changes.
  - Firmware does not de-bounce the switch pack.
  - One switch change can result in multiple bytes being sent.
  - Bits are in the reverse order of the labels on the pack (for example, bit 0x80 is labeled 1 on the pack).
- Bulk Endpoints are configured for loopback:
- The device moves data from IN endpoint to OUT endpoint.
  - The device does not change the values of the data it receives nor does it internally create any data.
  - Endpoints are always double buffered.
  - Maximum packet size depends on speed (64 full speed, 512 high speed).
- ETW events:
- Included osrusbfx2.man, which describes events added.
  - Three events are targeted to the event log:
    - Failure during the add device routine.
    - Failure to start the OSR device on a USB 1.1 controller.
    - Invocation of the "re-enumerate device" IOCTL.
  - Read/write start/stop events can be used to measure the time taken.

## Testing the driver

You can test this sample either by using the [Custom driver access](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=248288) sample application, or by using the osrusbfx2.exe test application. For information on how to build and use the osrusbfx2.exe application, see the test instructions for the [kmdf\_fx2](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/) sample.
