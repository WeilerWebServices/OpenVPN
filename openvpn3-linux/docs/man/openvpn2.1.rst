:Manual section: 1
:Manual group: OpenVPN 3 Linux

SYNOPSIS
========
| ``openvpn2`` [ OPTIONS ]
| ``openvpn2`` ``-h`` | ``--help``


DESCRIPTION
===========
The **openvpn2** front-end to OpenVPN 3 Linux attempts to provide a similar
command line interface as the classic **OpenVPN 2.x** releases.  Since
**OpenVPN 3** does not support all the options available in **OpenVPN 2.x**,
some options is not available or will be ignored.

In addition the OpenVPN 3 Linux project provides only a client at the moment,
so all server side related options are not available.


OPTIONS
=======

-h, --help            show this help message and exit

--auth ALG            Authenticate packets with HMAC using message digest
                      algorithm alg (default=SHA1)

--auth-user-pass      Authenticate with server using username/password

--ca FILE             Certificate authority file in .pem format containing
                      root certificate

--cd DIR              Change working directory to the given directory

--cert FILE           Certificate authority file in .pem format by a
                      Certificate Authority in ``--ca`` file

--cipher ALG          Encrypt packets with cipher algorithm alg (default=BF-
                      CBC)

--client              Configures client configuration mode (mandatory)

--comp-lzo <MODE>     Use LZO compression

--compress <ALG>      Compress using algorithm ALG

--config FILE         Read configuration options from file

--daemon              Run the VPN tunnel in the background

--dev DEV-NAME        Virtual interface name to use for VPN tunnel.
                      Defaults to :code:`tun`.  Usually ignored, as the
                      interface name is created on-the-fly in OpenVPN 3.

--dev-type DEV-TYPE   Defines the virtual interface type.  Only
                      :code:`tun` is supported, which is the default.

--dhcp-option OPTION  Set DHCP options which can be picked up by the OS
                      configuring DNS, etc.

--extra-certs FILE    Specify a file containing one or more PEM certs
                      (concatenated together) that complete the local
                      certificate chain.

--float               Allow remote to change its IP address/port.

--hand-window SEC     Handshake window.  The TLS-based key exchange must
                      finalize within SEC seconds handshake initiation by
                      any peer.  (Default 60 seconds)

--http-proxy ARGS
                      Connect to a remote host via a specified HTTP proxy.
                      This option takes 2 mandatory options, SERVER and PORT,
                      which defines the HTTP proxy and port to use.

                      Optional arguments are AUTH-FLAG which can be *auto-nct*
                      which enables clear-text passwords to be used.

                      OpenVPN 2.x also adds an optional AUTH-METHOD flag
                      as the last argument, this is auto-detected in
                      OpenVPN 3.

--http-proxy-user-pass FILE
                      Fetch HTTP proxy credentials from FILE

--ifconfig ARGS
                      Configures the TUN/TAP device for IPv4.  This option
                      takes two mandatory arguments, the IPv4 address to use
                      and the netmask for the network.

--ifconfig-ipv6 ARGS
                      Configures the TUN/TAP device for IPv6.  This option
                      takes one mandatory argument, the IPv6 address including
                      its PREFIX.  An optional REMOTE_ENDPOINT can be given
                      at the end.

--inactive ARGS
                      This option takes one mandatory argument, SECONDS, which
                      defines how many seconds the tunnel can idle before
                      disconnecting.  An optional BYTES argument can be added
                      which also takes the number of bytes passed over the
                      tunnel within SECONDS of inactivity.  The traffic must
                      be higher than this minimum BYTES to keep the tunnel
                      alive.

--keepalive ARGS
                      Instructs the client to ping the server over the
                      OpenVPN Control Channel every PING_SECONDS.  An optional
                      argument defines, RECONNECT_SECONDS how long it should go 
                      before the client should attempt to reconnect if there
                      is no response from the server.

                      can be specified (default: ``udp``).  This option can
                      be given multiple times and the client will try all
                      remote entries until it is able to establish a
                      connection.  The order of arguments are: *HOST/IP*,
                      *PORT* and *PROTOCOL*

                      established.  Multiple routes can be specified.

                      This option takes one mandatory argument, IP-ADDRESS
                      to route over the VPN.  The two optional arguments
                      are NETMASK (default: :code:`255.255.255.255`) and the
                      gateway to use (defaults to use configured
                      ``--route-gateway`` or the VPN server IP address).

--route-gateway <GW|dhcp>
                      Specify a default gateway for use with ``--route``.
                      See ``openvpn``\(8) man page for dhcp mode

--route-ipv6 ARGS
                      Add IPv6 route to routing table after connection is
                      established.  Multiple routes can be specified.

                      This option takes one mandatory argument IP-RANGE/PREFIX.
                      An optional *GATEWAY* can be set, which overrides the
                      default server VPN IPv6 address and the second
                      argument which sets the route *METRIC* value.

--setenv ARGS
                      Set a custom environmental variable to pass to script.
                      This takes two mandatory arguments, variable NAME
                      and VALUE.

--static-challenge ARGS
                      Enable static challenge/response protocol.  This
                      takes one mandatory option, *MESSAGE*, which will
                      be presented to the user before the connection
                      attempt.  An optional argument, *ECHO*, indicates
                      if the user input should be echoed back to the
                      user during input entry.

--tcp-queue-limit NUM
                      Maximum number (*NUM*)of queued TCP output packets

--tls-auth ARGS
                      Enables an additional HMAC authentication on TLS
                      control channel.  This takes a mandatory argument,
                      *FILE*, which must be a shared secret between server
                      and client.  The optional *KEY-DIRECTION* argument
                      defines which sub-key pair in *FILE* to use for HMAC
                      signing and verification.
                      Valid values are :code:`0` or :code:`1`.

--tls-cert-profile PROFILE
                      Sets certificate profile which defines acceptable
                      crypto algorithms.  Valid profiles: legacy, preferred,
                      suiteb

--tls-client          Enable TLS and assume client role during TLS
                      handshake.  Implicitly added when using ``--client``

--tls-crypt FILE      Encrypts the TLS control channel with a shared secret
                      key (FILE).  This CANNOT be combined with ``--tls-auth``

--tls-timeout SECS    Packet retransmit timeout on TLS control channel if
                      no ACK from remote within n seconds.
                      (Default: *2* seconds)

--topology TYPE       Set tunnel topology type.  Default is :code:`net30`.
                      Recommended: :code:`subnet`, but this must match the
                      server setting.
                      Valid topologies: :code:`subnet`, :code:`net30`

--tran-window SECS    Transition window -- old data channel key can live
                      this many seconds after new after new key renegotiation
                      begins.  (Default: :code:`3600` secs)

--tun-mtu SIZE        Set TUN/TAP device MTU to SIZE and derive TCP/UDP from
                      it (default is 1500)

--verb LEVEL          Set log verbosity level.  Log levels are NOT compatible
                      with OpenVPN 2 ``--verb``

--verify-x509-name ARGS
                     Accept connections only with a host with a specific
                     X509 subject or CN match string.  This option takes
                     one mandatory argument, which is a MATCH string and
                     an optional match FLAG.

                     FLAG can be:

                     :code:`name`
                       Match against complete X.509 Common Name field


                     :code:`name-prefix`
                       The MATCH value must be match the beginning of the
                       X.509 Common Name field.  If the X.509 certificate
                       contains :code:`server-1.example.org`, it will be a
                       match if the MATCH value is :code:`server-`.  It will
                       not be a match if values like :code:`server-2` or
                       :code:`.example.org` is used.


                     :code:`subject`
                       The MATCH value must be the full and complete
                       X.509 Subject field.  This is the default behaviour.


IGNORED OPTIONS
===============
The options in this list will be silently ignored.  Some of these options
have not yet been implemented in the OpenVPN 3 Core library and others
are not relevant any more.  But none of these options will break any
existing configurations.

--chroot DIR          Chroot to this directory after initialization.  Not
                      applicable with OpenVPN 3, which uses a different
                      execution model.

--dev-node NODE       OpenVPN 2.x will use /dev/net/tun, /dev/tun, /dev/tap,
                      etc by default when creating the tun/tap interface.  This
                      is handled differently in OpenVPN 3 Linux and is not
                      configurable by front-ends like ``openvpn2`` or
                      ``openvpn3``, since the virtual network interface creation
                      is handled by the ``openvpn3-service-netcfg``\(8) service.

--down                Run a script after the tunnel has been torn down.
                      Running scripts via OpenVPN 3 is not supported, and
                      using this option will display a warning.  See the
                      NOTES section below for details.

--down-pre            This is related to when the ``--down`` script is being
                      run during the disconnection.  See the NOTES section
                      below regarding script execution in OpenVPN 3.

--explicit-exit-notify <ATTEMPTS>
                        On exit/restart, send exit signal to remote end.
                        Automatically configured with OpenVPN 3

--group GROUP         Run OpenVPN with GROUP group credentials.  Not needed
                      with OpenVPN 3 which uses a different privilege
                      separation approach
--nice LEVEL          Change process priority.  Not supported in OpenVPN 3

--nobind              Do not bind to local address and port.  This is default
                      behaviour in OpenVPN 3
--persist-key         Do not re-read key files across connection restarts.
                      Not needed.  OpenVPN 3 keeps keys as embedded file
                      elements in the configuration

--rcvbuf SIZE         Set the TCP/UDP receive buffer size.  Not supported in
                      OpenVPN 3

--resolv-retry SECS   If hostname resolve fails for ``--remote``, retry
                      resolve for n seconds before failing.  Not supported
                      by OpenVPN 3.

--script-security LEVEL
                      This option is ignored, as OpenVPN 3 itself does not
                      execute any external scripts.

--sndbuf SIZE         Set the TCP/UDP send buffer size.  Not supported in
                      OpenVPN 3.

--socket-flags FLAGS
                      Applies flags to the transport socket.  Not supported
                      in OpenVPN 3.

--up                  Run a script after the tunnel has been established.
                      Running scripts via OpenVPN 3 is not supported, and
                      using this option will display a warning.  See the
                      NOTES section below for details.

--user USER           Run OpenVPN with USER user credentials.  Not needed
                      with OpenVPN 3 which uses a different privilege
                      separation approach


NOTES
=====

SCRIPT EXECUTION
----------------

OpenVPN 3 does not implement any support for running external scripts or program
during its life cycle.  This is by design.  Running scripts is a security risk,
and needs to be handled carefully.  In classic OpenVPN 2.x setups, scripts are
run with the same privileges as the ``openvpn``\(8) process.  If the process is
started as root, the script may be run as root.  Which is why the
``--script-security`` option is available and by default disabling running most
external programs.

This does not mean it is impossible to trigger programs to perform operations
when certain OpenVPN events occur.  OpenVPN 3 Linux is using D-Bus actively and
it issues several signals as the state changes.  It also means you can write
your own front-end doing its own calls how you prefer while starting and
managing the VPN session at the same time.  This allows a much better
flexibility and allows to adopt VPN session management into the execution flow
which is needed.  And the implementation can do its own security assessments on
how it will tackle these scenarios.

There are at least three ways how to adopt to the OpenVPN 3 model:

1.  Watching D-Bus StateChange signals for your own sessions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a session is started, it is possible to subscribe to signals issued by the
VPN client process over D-Bus.  It is only possible to subscribe to signals
related to the session owner's own sessions.  These signals are sent by the
Session Manager (``net.openvpn.v3.sessions``,
``openvpn3-service-sessionmgr``\(8))

Example:
::

    $ dbus-monitor --system --monitor sender=net.openvpn.v3.sessions,interface=net.openvpn.v3.sessions,member=StatusChange


2.  Manage the life cycle of VPN sessions on your own
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This means wrapping the starting of VPN sessions on your own.  Either you wrap
``openvpn3 session-start`` or ``openvpn2`` calls in your own scripts, or you can
connect directly to the Configuration Manager (``net.openvpn.v3.configuration``,
``openvpn3-service-configmgr``\(8)) and Session Manager
(``net.openvpn.v3.sessions``, ``openvpn3-service-sessionmgr``\(8)) to import
configuration profiles and start/stop VPN sessions as needed, as well as
subscribing to D-Bus signals as well to handle various the states a VPN session
will go through.  This is fairly simple to do using the already available
openvpn3 Python module.  Example code can be found in the
`OpenVPN 3 Linux source tree`_ [#srctree]_
or by studying the source code of ``openvpn2``\(1) and ``openvpn3-autoload``\(8),
which both are Python scripts.

Configurations and sessions managed via D-Bus by your own scripts can still be
further managed by the ``openvpn3``\(1) command line interface.


3.  Subscribing to NetworkChange signals from `net.openvpn.v3.netcfg`_ [#netcfgsrv]_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is also a scripting possibility, which is more useful for system wide
script triggering.  A program or script can subscribe to specific network change
events caused by OpenVPN sessions.  These signals contains information about
virtual network interfaces which has been created or removed, IP addresses added
or removed from devices, routing configuration as well as DNS resolver changes.

For an example how to do this, see the `example script`_ [#examplescript]_
in the OpenVPN 3 Linux source directory.

**Please note** that, by default, this script must be run as ``root`` or the
``openvpn`` user on the system.  It is possible to allow other users or groups
this privilege, by extending the D-Bus policy for the ``net.openvpn.v3.netcfg``
service.  But granting this privilege too widely may result in unwanted
information leakage related to VPN interface configurations.
