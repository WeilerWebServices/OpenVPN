SYNOPSIS
========
| ``openvpn3-admin log-service`` ``[OPTIONS]``
| ``openvpn3-admin log-service`` ``-h`` | ``--help``


DESCRIPTION
===========
This manages a few adjustable knobs available in the ``openvpn3-service-logger``
when run as a D-Bus service.  The access control for this command is managed in
the D-Bus policy, which by default is only allowed for the *root* and
*@OPENVPN_USERNAME@* user accounts.


OPTIONS
=======

-h, --help      Print  usage and help details to the terminal

--log-level LEVEL
                Sets the system wide log verbosity for the log events being
                logged to file or any other log destination
                ``openvpn3-service-logger`` is configured to use.  Valid values
                are :code:`0` to :code:`6`.  The higher value, the more verbose the log
                events will be.  Log level :code:`6` will contain all debug events.

--timestamp BOOL
                Some of the log destinations supported by
                ``openvpn3-service-logger`` may allow to log with or without
                timestamps.  This option enables or disables timestamps attached
                to log events.  Valid arguments: :code:`true`, :code:`false`.

--dbus-details BOOL
                Each log event contains some more detailed meta-data of the
                sender of the log event.  This is disabled by default, but when
                enabled it will add a line on the log destination
                before the log event itself with this meta-data.  This is mostly
                only useful when debugging and not recommended for normal
                production.  Valid arguments: :code:`true`, :code:`false`

--list-subscriptions
                Lists all the services the log service has subscribed to.
