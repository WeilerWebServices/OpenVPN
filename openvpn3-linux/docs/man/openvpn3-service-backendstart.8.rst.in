:Manual group: OpenVPN 3 Linux

SYNOPSIS
========
| ``openvpn3-service-backendstart`` ``[OPTIONS]``
| ``openvpn3-service-backendstart`` ``-h`` | ``--help``


DESCRIPTION
===========
This service is automatically started when the ``openvpn3-service-sessionmgr``
requests a new VPN tunnel to be initiated.  This service has the responsibility
to start the ``openvpn3-service-client`` process and provide enough information
to it so it can register itself against a session object in the
``openvpn3-service-sessionmgr`` service.

This service is normally started automatically when needed, via the
*net.openvpn.v3.backendstart.service* auto-start configuration by the
``dbus-daemon``\(1), but can also be started manually on the command line.  Beware
that running this with another user account than *@OPENVPN_USERNAME@* also requires
updating the D-Bus policy as well.


OPTIONS
=======
-h, --help      Print  usage and help details to the terminal

--version       Prints the version of the program and exists

--log-level LEVEL
                Sets the default log verbosity for log events generated by
                this service.  The default is :code:`3`.  Valid values are
                :code:`0` to :code:`6`.  Higher log levels results in more
                verbose logs and log level :code:`6` will contain all debug
                log events.

--signal-broadcast
                Normally, the ``openvpn3-service-backendstart`` will attach a
                log stream to the ``openvpn3-service-logger`` service.  By
                providing this option, it will instead broadcast all log events
                to all listeners on the system.  This is more useful for
                debugging when the standard logging does not provide any clues.
                This is not recommended for production.

--client-log-level LEVEL
                This adds the ``--log-level`` option with the given argument
                when starting the ``openvpn3-service-client`` process.

--client-colour
                This adds the ``--colour`` option when starting the
                ``openvpn3-service-client`` process.

--client-disable-protect-socket
                This adds the ``--disable-protect-socket`` option when starting
                the ``openvpn3-service-client`` process.

--client-signal-broadcast
                This adds the ``--signal-broadcast`` option when starting the
                ``openvpn3-service-client`` process.
