SYNOPSIS
========
| ``openvpn3-service-client`` ``[OPTIONS]``
| ``openvpn3-service-client`` ``-h`` | ``--help``


DESCRIPTION
===========
The ``openvpn3-service-client`` process is a backend service for OpenVPN 3
Linux, responsible for a single VPN session.  This service will be started
automatically by the ``openvpn3-service-backendstart`` starts, which is
initiated when the ``openvpn3-service-sessionmgr`` is requested to start a new
VPN session.

It will run one ``openvpn3-service-client`` per active VPN session.

This service must be started by the ``openvpn3-service-backendstart`` process,
as it gather more information from the session manager before starting the
client process with the given arguments.  This process must run as the *@OPENVPN_USERNAME@*
user and requires no privileges.  All privileged operations, like creating and
configuring the virtual network adapter, IP addresses, routes and DNS, is
handled by a the ``openvpn3-service-netcfg`` service.

Beware that running this with another user account than *@OPENVPN_USERNAME@* also requires
updating the D-Bus policy as well.


OPTIONS
=======

-h, --help      Print  usage and help details to the terminal

--version       Prints the version of the program and exists

--log-level LEVEL
                Sets the default log verbosity for log events generated by
                this service.  The default is :code:`4`.  Valid values are
                :code:`0` to :code:`6`.  Higher log levels results in more
                verbose logs and log level :code:`6` will contain all debug
                log events.

--log-file LOG_DESTINATION
                By default, logging will go via the ``openvpn3-service-logger``
                service.  By providing this argument, logging will also be sent
                to *LOG_DESTINATION*, which can be either a filename or
                :code:`stdout:` where the latter one sends log data to the
                console.

--colour
                This will add colours to log events when logging to file
                or terminal.  Log events will be coloured based on the log
                level of the event.

--signal-broadcast
                Normally, the ``openvpn3-service-client`` will attach a
                log stream to the ``openvpn3-service-logger`` service.  By
                providing this option, it will instead broadcast all log events
                to all listeners on the system.  This is more useful for
                debugging when the standard logging does not provide any clues.
                This is not recommended for production and may leak session
                sensitive information.

--disable-protect-socket
                The VPN client can protect the socket being used for the UDP/TCP
                connection to the VPN server from being routed over the VPN
                itself.  This makes the routing table simpler and does not need
                any specific routing entries if the default gateway is changed.
                Unfortunately, this does not work on all systems and to get a
                functional VPN tunnel, this socket protection needs to be
                disabled.  By setting this option, it will not be possible
                to make use of the ``--set-somark`` feature in
                ``openvpn3-service-netcfg``.
