SYNOPSIS
========
| ``openvpn3-service-sessionmgr`` ``[OPTIONS]``
| ``openvpn3-service-sessionmgr`` ``-h`` | ``--help``


DESCRIPTION
===========
The ``openvpn3-service-sessionmgr`` is a backend service for OpenVPN 3 Linux,
responsible for managing running OpenVPN sessions.  Once a VPN session has been
started, either via ``openvpn3 session-start`` or ``openvpn2``,  it will run in
the background as a D-Bus service as long as it has at least one active VPN
session running.

Only one session manager process can run on the system.

VPN sessions are managed via the ``openvpn3 session-manage`` and
``openvpn3 session-acl`` commands and new VPN sessions are started using
the ``openvpn3 session-start`` command.

This service is normally started automatically when needed, via the
*net.openvpn.v3.sessionmgr.service* auto-start configuration by the
``dbus-daemon``\(1), but can also be started manually on the command line.  This
process should run as the *@OPENVPN_USERNAME@* user and will automatically switch to this
user account if it has the needed privileges to do so.  Beware that changing
this to another user account also requires updating the D-Bus policy as well.


OPTIONS
=======

-h, --help      Print  usage and help details to the terminal

--version       Prints the version of the program and exists

--log-level LEVEL
                Sets the default log verbosity for log events generated by
                this service.  The default is :code:`3`.  Valid values are
                :code:`0` to :code:`6`.  Higher log levels results in more
                verbose logs and log level :code:`6` will contain all debug
                log events.

--log-file LOG_DESTINATION
                By default, logging will go via the ``openvpn3-service-logger``
                service.  By providing this argument, logging will also be sent
                to *LOG_DESTINATION*, which can be either a filename or
                :code:`stdout:` where the latter one sends log data to the
                console.

--colour
                This will add colours to log events when logging to file
                or terminal.  Log events will be coloured based on the log
                level of the event.

--signal-broadcast
                Normally, the ``openvpn3-service-sessionmgr`` will attach a
                log stream to the ``openvpn3-service-logger`` service.  By
                providing this option, it will instead broadcast all log events
                to all listeners on the system.  This is more useful for
                debugging when the standard logging does not provide any clues.
                This is not recommended for production.

--idle-exit MINUTES
                The ``openvpn3-service-sessionmgr`` service will exit
                automatically if it is being idle for *MINUTES* minutes.  By
                being idle, it means no VPN sessions are running and managed
                by this service.  This can be validated by running
                ``openvpn3 sessions-list``.  If this results in an empty list,
                no configuration profiles are being managed.
