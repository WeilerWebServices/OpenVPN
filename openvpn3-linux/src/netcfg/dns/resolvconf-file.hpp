 * @file   resolvconf-file.hpp
 *
 * @brief  This will update resolv.conf files directly, in the typical
 *         resolv.conf format.  Normally, this would be /etc/resolv.conf, but
 *         can be used for other files as well, if there is a local
 *         resolver service which picks these files some elsewhere.
