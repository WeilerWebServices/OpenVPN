clinetcfg - simple client using openvpn3-service-netcfg
=======================================================

This test client is the same as found in the openvpn3-core/test/ovpncli/cli.cpp
with the exception that it uses openvpn3-service-netcfg (net.openvpn.v3.netcfg)
to configure the virtual network adapter and routes.  This allows the test
client to run unprivileged.

As the access to the net.openvpn.v3.netcfg D-Bus service is managed by a
policy and this policy restricts this access to the 'openvpn' user only, it
is needed to relax this policy first before attempting to run this test
client.  This can be done by copying the
`net.openvpn.v3.netcfg-generic-access.conf` file to the D-Bus policy
directory, typically located at `/etc/dbus-1/system.d`.
