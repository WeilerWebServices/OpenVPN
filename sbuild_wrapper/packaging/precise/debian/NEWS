openvpn (2.1~rc15-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The openvpn utility changed its handling of pkcs11 certificates when it
    switched from built-in code to the pkcs11-helper library (package
    libpkcs11-helper1 on Debian). This means that you will have to update your
    openvpn configuration files if you are using such certificates. For
    example, a stanza in a configuration file might previously have referred to
    a given pkcs11 certificate like this:

      pkcs11-providers /usr/lib/opensc-pkcs11.so
      pkcs11-slot-type id
      pkcs11-slot 0
      pkcs11-id-type label
      pkcs11-id "YOUR_LABEL"

    This stanza has to be rewritten now in the following way:

      pkcs11-providers /usr/lib/opensc-pkcs11.so
      pkcs11-id 'YOUR_PKCS11_SERIALIZED_ID'

    The pkcs11-slot, pkcs11-slot-type, pkcs11-id-type options are obsolete;
    a long ID string that is unique for each certificate is now used as the
    only identifier. Note that YOUR_PKCS11_SERIALIZED_ID will almost
    certainly be different from YOUR_LABEL that you used previously with the
    pkcs11-id option. To find out the correct serialized ID(s) for your
    certificate(s), you have to query the pkcs11-provider library:

      $ openvpn --show-pkcs11-ids /usr/lib/opensc-pkcs11.so 
    
    The following objects are available for use.
    Each object shown below may be used as parameter to --pkcs11-id option
    please remember to use single quote mark.
    
      Certificate
           DN:             /CN=YOUR_USER
           Serial:         SERIAL_NUMBER
           Serialized id:  YOUR_PKCS11_SERIALIZED_ID

    You have to paste YOUR_PKCS11_SERIALIZED_ID as seen in this output into
    your openvpn configuration file and make sure that the string is enclosed
    in single quotation marks.

    The example above assumes that your cryptographic token can be accessed
    via the opensc-pkcs11.so library from libopensc2. If you have to use
    another library, for example a proprietary driver from the vendor of your
    token, then you have to adapt both the stanza in the configuration file
    and the path given on the command line accordingly.

openvpn (2.1~rc9-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Calling of external commands/scripts 

    Starting with version 2.1~rc9, openvpn has a new option to control the
    ability to execute external commands (--script-security).

    By default (script-security 1) it will only allow the execution of
    built-in commands (ip, ifconfig, route,...). If you require the execution
    of external commands, such as /etc/openvpn/update-resolv-conf, you'll have
    to include the following option in your configuration file:
    script-security 2
