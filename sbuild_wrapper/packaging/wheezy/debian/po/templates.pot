"A weakness has been discovered in the random number generator used by "
"OpenSSL on Ubuntu and Debian systems.  As a result of this weakness, certain "
"encryption keys are generated much more frequently than they should be, such "
"that an attacker could guess the key through a brute-force attack given "
"minimal knowledge of the system."

"Any keys created on a vulnerable system may be affected by this problem. The "
"'openssl-vulnkey' command may be used as a partial test for RSA keys with "
"certain bit sizes, and the 'openvpn-vulnkey' for OpenVPN shared secret keys. "
"Users are urged to verify their keys or simply regenerate any server or "
"client certificates and keys in use on the system."
